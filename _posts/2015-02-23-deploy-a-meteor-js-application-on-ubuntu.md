## 1. Installing Meteor-Up

In your local app directory, run:
	sudo npm install -g mup
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
    sudo apt-get install sshpass
    
If you need to update MUP to the latest version in the future:
    npm update mup -g

## 2. Creating and Configuring a Meteor-Up Project

In your local app directory, run:
	mup init
    
Open mup.json and enter your credentials, host, username, password, nodeVersion should be 0.10.28 or greater

{
  // Server authentication info
  "servers": [
    {
      "host": "",
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
      // or pem file (ssh based authentication)
      //"pem": "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    }
  ],

  // Install MongoDB in the server, does not destroy local MongoDB on future setup
  "setupMongo": true,

  // WARNING: Node.js is required! Only skip if you already have Node.js installed on server.
  "setupNode": true,

  // WARNING: If nodeVersion omitted will setup 0.10.33 by default. Do not use v, only version number.
  "nodeVersion": "0.10.33",

  // Install PhantomJS in the server
  "setupPhantom": true,

  // Application name (No spaces)
  "appName": "Idretis",

  // Location of app (local directory)
  "app": "/home/jerome/meteor/csm",

  // Configure environment
  "env": {
    "PORT": 3000,
    "UPSTART_UID": "meteoruser", // The user you want to run meteor as.
    "ROOT_URL": "http://app.idretis.com"
  },

  // Meteor Up checks if the app comes online just after the deployment
  // before mup checks that, it will wait for no. of seconds configured below
  "deployCheckWaitTime": 35
}

After all info is saved, run 
	mup setup
now the script will setup all required dependencies for the meteor app, like node, phantom and mongodb.

## 3. Deploying your Application

If everything went well, next command is 
	mup deploy
the script will upload your app to the server and convert the app into plain node.js application.

## 4. Installing and Configuring nginx

Just run:
	sudo apt-get install nginx

SSH to your server and 
	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    
[CTRL+O] to save the file
    
The config file looks like this

server {
	listen *:80;
	server_name app.idetis.com;
    location / {
    	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    	proxy_http_version 1.1;
    	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    	proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    }
}

In this case, nginx listens on port 80 for app.idretis.com and then proxies localhost:3000.

To restart nginx:
	/etc/init.d/nginx restart

## 5. Browsing Your Application Server Logs

To tail logs from the server, just run:
	mup logs -n1000
with the -n option, the tail command displays the last 1,000 lines
	mup logs -F
with the -F option, the tail command updates the display as new lines are added to the logs by another process

## 6. Reconfiguring and Restarting Your Application

When youâ€™ve edited some of your environment variables in the configuration file, you can ask MUP to reconfigure and restart your application using the following command:
	mup reconfig
